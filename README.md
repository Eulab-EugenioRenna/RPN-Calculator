# RPN Calculator

A simple Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator built with JavaScript. This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using the postfix notation, where operators follow their operands.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Stack-based calculation for handling RPN expressions.
- Clear and reset functionality for the stack. 
- Responsive user interface for interacting with the calculator.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Operands**: Input numbers into the calculator.
2. **Enter Operators**: After inputting the operands, enter the operator to perform the operation.
   - For example, to compute `3 5 +`, you would enter `3`, `5`, and then `+`. The result `8` will be shown.
3. **Stack-Based Operations**: The calculator uses a stack to store numbers. You can enter multiple operands before applying an operator.
4. **Reset**: Use the reset button to clear the stack and start over.

### Example Operations

- `3 5 +` → `8`
- `10 2 /` → `5`
- `4 2 3 + *` → `20`
